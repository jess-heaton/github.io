Last night set up docker instance on Render 
 - then found out dont need to self host to use native n8n mcp servers

Working if and how I cld set this up for Stannp.


Today set up gmail email drafting with n8n.

 Set up RAG pipeline w Vectorize -> n8n - now just ui - maybe just voiceflow? Custom with Google apps?

 Wow remember so little!

 Workout - walk to UNi - jog :)
